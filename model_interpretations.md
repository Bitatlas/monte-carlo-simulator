# Practical Interpretation of Model Results

This guide explains how to practically interpret the results from each simulation model and the key differences between them.

## Standard Monte Carlo Model

### Interpretation of Results
- **Median Final Value**: The middle outcome - a typical result you might expect
- **Mean Final Value**: Usually higher than the median due to the unlimited upside but limited downside
- **Confidence Intervals**: The range where most outcomes fall - wider intervals indicate more uncertainty
- **Maximum Drawdown**: The worst peak-to-trough decline you should be prepared to withstand

### Practical Applications
- Use this model for quick estimates and first-pass analysis
- Best for stable market conditions without regime changes
- Suitable for shorter time horizons (1-5 years) where volatility is relatively constant

### Limitations
- Underestimates tail risks (extreme events)
- Doesn't capture volatility clustering or market regimes
- Assumes returns are independent day-to-day (no momentum or mean reversion)

## Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Model

### Interpretation of Results
- **Final Distribution**: More realistic as asset paths can't go below zero
- **Volatility Impact**: Higher volatility has a stronger drag effect than in standard Monte Carlo
- **Path Dependence**: The exact sequence of returns matters more than in standard Monte Carlo

### Practical Applications
- More theoretically sound for stock price modeling
- Better for options pricing and derivative analysis
- Good for modeling leveraged instruments where the path matters

### Limitations
- Still assumes constant volatility
- Doesn't capture fat tails or black swan events well
- Assumes continuous price changes (no gaps or jumps)

## GARCH(1,1) Model

### Interpretation of Results
- **Fatter Tails**: Expect more extreme outcomes in both directions
- **Volatility Clustering**: Periods of high volatility followed by more high volatility
- **Higher Drawdowns**: Generally shows larger potential drawdowns than simpler models

### Practical Applications
- Best during and after market turbulence
- Use for stress testing portfolios
- Excellent for risk management and calculating more realistic Value-at-Risk

### Limitations
- More complex to understand and explain
- Requires more historical data for parameter estimation
- Can sometimes overestimate volatility persistence

## Markov Chain Model

### Interpretation of Results
- **Regime-Based**: Results show transitions between different market states
- **State Persistence**: Captures tendency of markets to stay in bull or bear modes
- **Non-Normal Distribution**: Often shows more realistic multi-modal return distributions

### Practical Applications
- Ideal for cyclical markets or assets
- Good for modeling assets that switch between growth and value regimes
- Useful for long-term strategic asset allocation

### Limitations
- Discrete states are a simplification of continuous reality
- Number of states chosen affects results significantly
- Transition probabilities may not be stable over time

## Feynman Path Integral Model

### Interpretation of Results
- **Complex Dynamics**: Captures intricate market behaviors beyond simple models
- **Tail Risk**: Better representation of extreme but rare events
- **Path Exploration**: Considers many possible future paths, including unlikely ones

### Practical Applications
- Advanced risk analysis for sophisticated investors
- Modeling complex derivatives and structured products
- Research into market anomalies and inefficiencies

### Limitations
- Most complex model to understand and interpret
- Computationally intensive
- May find patterns in noise if overfit

## Key Differences Between Models

### Standard Monte Carlo vs. GBM
- GBM ensures prices remain positive (more realistic)
- GBM accounts for compounding effects better
- Standard Monte Carlo is simpler and more intuitive

### GBM vs. GARCH
- GARCH captures time-varying volatility; GBM assumes constant volatility
- GARCH typically shows higher tail risks
- GBM is more widely used in financial theory and practice

### GARCH vs. Markov Chain
- GARCH models volatility changes continuously; Markov Chain uses discrete states
- Markov Chain can capture structural shifts better
- GARCH is more focused on volatility; Markov Chain on overall regimes

### Markov Chain vs. Path Integral
- Path Integral is more mathematically sophisticated
- Markov Chain is more interpretable
- Path Integral can capture more complex dynamics

## Which Model to Use When

### During Stable Markets
- Standard Monte Carlo or GBM are sufficient
- Focus on the median outcomes and narrow confidence intervals

### During Volatile Periods
- GARCH provides more realistic volatility estimates
- Pay attention to the wider confidence intervals and higher drawdowns

### For Long-Term Planning
- Markov Chain captures regime shifts that matter over decades
- Consider all scenarios, especially the lower percentiles for safety

### For Risk Management
- Use multiple models and compare their tail risk estimates
- GARCH and Path Integral typically provide more conservative risk estimates

### For Leveraged Investments
- Always use GARCH or Markov Chain to better capture downside risks
- Pay special attention to maximum drawdown statistics
- Consider using half the suggested Kelly leverage

By understanding these different models and their practical interpretations, you can make more informed investment decisions based on the simulation results.
