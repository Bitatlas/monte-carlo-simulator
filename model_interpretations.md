# Practical Interpretation of Model Results

Each simulation model has different assumptions and characteristics. Here's how to interpret the results from each model:

## üìä Standard Monte Carlo

**Key Characteristics:**
- Assumes normal distribution of returns
- Independence between time periods
- Constant volatility

**When Interpreting Results:**
- Good for baseline projections
- Less accurate for highly volatile assets
- May underestimate tail risks (extreme events)
- Works best for longer time horizons where central limit theorem applies

**Confidence Level Guidance:**
- Use wider confidence intervals (e.g., 90% instead of 68%)
- Pay attention to worst-case scenarios in addition to median outcomes
- Consider supplementing with other models for volatile assets

## üìà Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Models continuous-time price movements
- Log-returns follow normal distribution
- More mathematically sound than standard Monte Carlo

**When Interpreting Results:**
- More appropriate for modeling equity prices
- Captures the multiplicative nature of returns
- Still underestimates extreme events
- Better suited for pricing derivatives

**Confidence Level Guidance:**
- GBM provides more realistic path trajectories
- Time-consistent simulations (scaling properties)
- Still subject to limitations of normal distribution assumptions

## üìâ GARCH(1,1)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Models volatility clustering
- Captures time-varying volatility
- Better represents market turbulence periods

**When Interpreting Results:**
- Higher probability of extreme events than normal models
- More realistic in periods of market stress
- Better captures volatility persistence
- May show "fat tails" in the distribution

**Confidence Level Guidance:**
- Pay special attention to drawdown metrics
- More realistic risk assessment in turbulent markets
- Better at representing periods of high volatility

## ‚õìÔ∏è Markov Chain

**Key Characteristics:**
- Captures regime-switching behavior
- Represents discrete market states
- Models persistence of bull/bear markets

**When Interpreting Results:**
- Look for multi-modal distributions
- Better captures "fat tails" than normal models
- Shows potential for extended bull or bear runs
- Results highly dependent on number of states chosen

**Confidence Level Guidance:**
- Examine the state transition matrix
- Consider how long the model predicts staying in each regime
- Useful for identifying potential regime shifts

## üîÑ Feynman Path Integral

**Key Characteristics:**
- Quantum-inspired approach
- Models complex path dependencies
- Better representation of rare events

**When Interpreting Results:**
- Captures complex market dynamics
- More sophisticated modeling of unusual market conditions
- May show paths not represented in other models
- Computational intensity can vary results

**Confidence Level Guidance:**
- Most appropriate for research purposes
- Consider as complementary to traditional models
- Useful for stress-testing and exploring extreme scenarios
