# Fixed Deployment Package for AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Error Resolution

We've addressed the Elastic Beanstalk error:

> Invalid option specification (Namespace: 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:managedactions', OptionName: 'ManagedActionsEnabled'): Managed platform updates require enhanced health reporting (option SystemType in namespace aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system).

## What Was Fixed

We updated the `.ebextensions/01_streamlit.config` file to include:

1. Enhanced health reporting:
   ```yaml
   aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system:
     SystemType: enhanced
   ```

2. Proper managed actions configuration:
   ```yaml
   aws:elasticbeanstalk:managedactions:
     ManagedActionsEnabled: true
     PreferredStartTime: "Tue:09:00"
   ```

## New Deployment Package

A new deployment package has been created with these fixes:

```
C:\Users\henri\Desktop\monte_carlo_simulator\monte_carlo_simulator_v2.zip
```

## How to Use the New Package

1. When uploading your application to Elastic Beanstalk, use this new ZIP file instead of the original one
2. The new configuration will properly enable enhanced health reporting
3. All other settings remain the same as described in the master deployment guide

## Deployment Steps Reminder

1. Follow the steps in MASTER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
2. In the "Application Code" section, upload this new ZIP file:
   - `monte_carlo_simulator_v2.zip`
3. Use version label: `v2` or `fixed-health-reporting`
4. Complete the remaining configuration steps as before

This new package should resolve the error and allow your Elastic Beanstalk environment to deploy successfully.
